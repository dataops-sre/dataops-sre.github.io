The idea that the public sector is inherently slow and inefficient has fueled a common belief: wherever possible, government services should be handed over to private companies. This rhetoric is pervasive in society today.

A popular success story backing this view is Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Musk founded SpaceX by employing numerous former NASA engineers and scientists, aiming to create reusable and affordable rockets. He overcame multiple failures and periods of near-bankruptcy, ultimately succeeding against the odds. Now, NASA contracts SpaceX to send astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) at a fraction of prior costs. To many, this story illustrates the inefficiency of public institutions like NASA. With access to similar talent and billions in taxpayer funding, NASA could not match SpaceX’s achievements. Musk is celebrated as a genius for his tenacity, resourcefulness, and business acumen.

Yet, the story doesn’t end there. Building on SpaceX’s cost-effective rockets, Musk initiated the Starlink project. Hundreds of Thousands of mini-satellites are being launched to create a vast network that will eventually provide global internet access -- even to the most remote areas. 

## Re-examining the Narrative

I want to examine this story from a different angle. NASA, as a public institution, operates with taxpayer money, making all citizens its shareholders. Musk, on the other hand, is accountable to his investors. This distinction creates a major difference in objectives and responsibilities.

SpaceX’s goal is to produce affordable rockets to serve growing commercial demand. in fact, Musk may have had the Starlink project in mind during SpaceX’s development phase, and investors were likely drawn to this ambitious vision. For NASA, even with highly skilled engineers and scientists, there was little incentive to pour billions into developing cheap rockets since the low frequency of trips to the ISS would hardly justify the investment. Unlike a private company, if a NASA project failed, it would face intense scrutiny, potentially affecting other scientific initiatives and undermining its credibility. In contrast, if SpaceX fails, only a few billionaire investors bear the consequences — likely with minimal impact on their lives or on Musk’s reputation.

Having taxpayers as stakeholders also means NASA must balance progress with responsibility. Recently, I read an article discussing scientists' concerns over Starlink satellites. These satellites are making it increasingly difficult to observe the night sky from Earth, and many experts worry about the potential for space debris. Collisions with abandonned satellites could create so much debris that future space missions become impossible, impacting society in a catastrophic ways(e.g., loss of GPS, global communication, air travel). NASA would likely never launch a project like Starlink for these reasons: it would not only conflict with its scientific objectives but would also go against taxpayer interests.

## The Limits of Private Sector Efficiency

While SpaceX’s accomplishments are impressive, Musk is not a tech genius or visionary guru. His achievements are grounded in vision and tenacity, but also in the limited accountability he has to a small group of investors. In a conflict of interest between public welfare and private returns, it’s likely Musk would prioritize his investors. In the case of Starlink, Musk is exploiting a shared resource -- Earth’s orbit -- in a way that may endanger long-term societal interests, all in pursuit of profit.

That said, there is undoubtedly room for improvement in public sector efficiency. However, we shouldn’t naively believe that privatization is always the answer, especially when regulation struggles to keep pace with rapid technological advances.
